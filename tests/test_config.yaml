## 2. Test Execution Workflow

### 2.1 Prerequisites
- All agent SRS/contract files in `/specs` must be **ratified**  
- Test environment configured with **mock APIs and data sources**  
- Supervisor Agent must be capable of orchestrating test execution  

### 2.2 Testing Approach
1. **Isolated Agent Testing**
   - Each agent is tested against its SRS/contract  
   - Verify responsibilities, inputs/outputs, constraints, and failure behavior  
   - Use mock data or simulated API responses where needed  

2. **Integrated Workflow Testing**
   - Supervisor Agent orchestrates all agents  
   - Verify task sequencing, retry handling, and escalation  
   - Ensure Safety Agent detects unsafe outputs and halts execution if needed  

3. **Acceptance Criteria Verification**
   - Each test case defines **measurable pass/fail criteria**  
   - Logs must be produced for auditing and debugging  

### 2.3 Test Automation Notes
- Tests may later be automated using Python, Node.js, or any preferred framework  
- API mocks or stubs can simulate external social media platforms  
- Continuous integration (CI) pipelines should **run all acceptance tests before code merges**  

---

## 3. Test Governance
- No agent implementation should bypass these acceptance tests  
- Each test failure must be investigated and **resolved before ratification**  
- Safety-critical failures must trigger **immediate escalation to Product Owner**

## 4. Links to Agent Tests

| Agent | Test File | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Influencer Agent | `influencer_agent.tests.md` | Tests discovery, ranking, metrics, reporting, alerts |
| Research Agent   | `research_agent.tests.md`   | Tests research, normalization, trend detection, reporting |
| Generation Agent | `generation_agent.tests.md` | Tests content generation, recommendations, error handling |
| Safety Agent     | `safety_agent.tests.md`     | Tests safety monitoring, violation detection, escalation |
| Supervisor Agent | `supervisor_agent.tests.md` | Tests orchestration, retries, state machine, reporting |

## 5. Ratification & Approval
These tests are **binding verification artifacts**.  
No implementation in `/src` shall bypass these tests.  

**Approval Signatures:**  
- [ ] Product Owner  
- [ ] Technical Lead  
- [ ] Compliance Officer
